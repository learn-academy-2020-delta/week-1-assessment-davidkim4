# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: Functions are ways to store directions all onto one word by taking in an argument. 

  Researched answer: A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.

2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() allows users to reformat all index values of an array, whereas .filter() takes out certain index values.

  Researched answer: They do different things: . filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while . map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array.

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() prints out the results of the called function on the terminal, whereas return gives you back a value that you are specifically looking for and is stored in the function. 

  Researched answer: Return is used to interrupt the flow of execution of a function and return some value (or not). console.log() is used to print information to the console (acessible by F12) of the browser.

4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is what you run through the function to reformat.

  Researched answer: Arguments are the values or variables that you pass to a function when calling it.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Give each person an equal amount of work to do. Communicate communicate communicate. Don't be afraid of each other.
               Navigator - the one who reads the instructions and tells the driver what to write down.
               Driver - the one who listens to the navigator and writes the code down.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: I don't remember what TDD is or stands for...

  Researched answer: Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. Test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Something in class this week that I found helpful was the office hours session. It taught me about edabit and now I'm looking into using it as a tool for extra practice outside of class.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React: a very convenient framework that allow users to create a pleasant UI.

- Yarn: a package manager that links all your files together??? (didn't quite understand all the new terms and how they're related...)

- React State: where you store information about dynamic UI sections. If the state changes, the change is shown visually on teh specific UI component that it is linked to.

- CRUD: stands for 'create, read, update, delete' and is a paradigm that users follow as a reminder to create usable functions. 

- this: a keyword used in programming to refer back to an existing data type within the function you are calling on.
